Step #1: Set up a staging site

 A staging site is basically a copy of your site where you can test changes so you don’t accidentally break your live site.
 Because it’s an exact duplicate of your site’s server, settings, and content, you can see how the new block editor will work on your specific site. ...</div>

                                    <div itemprop="description" class="article-preview">We've tried hard to make The Events Calendar play nicely with as many themes as possible. Unfortunately, because of the incredible amount of diversity among themes, it is simply impossible to make our calendar look perfect in every single case.
 Fear not, however, as there are a number of ways you can tweak things. Depending on the nature and severity of the problem, it can often be quite simple to remedy theme display issues.
 

Start with the Events Template Setting

 Your first stop should be...</div>

                                    <div itemprop="description" class="article-preview">You might already be a lot more familiar with how the Featured Image works for The Events Calendar than you know. That's because it's built on top of the same Featured Image functionality that comes standard with WordPress.
 In this post, we're going to dive into the concept of Featured Images a little deeper. We'll review how to add them to an event post, cover how to style them in CSS and, lastly, how to change the size.
 

Adding Featured Images to an Event Post

 Do you regularly have events that are scheduled to end after midnight? If so, you've probably noticed that these events will span the course of two different days on the month view of your calendar. This probably isn't the way you would like for that event to display, is it?
 Fortunately, there is a simple way to fix this issue! Within the General Events Settings tab you'll see an option to control the "End of day cutoff." ...</div>

How to Export Events

 You're in luck. The Events Calendar PRO includes a nifty option for you and your visitors to export the events on your calendar in a flash. Visit your calendar and you'll notice a button at the bottom.
 
 Click that button and it will download the events listed on the page as an .ics file.
