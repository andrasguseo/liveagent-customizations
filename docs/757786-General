 WordPress version 5.0 introduced the block editor, which you may already be using for posts and pages. In this article, we're going to demonstrate a process for testing Block Editor functionality with The Events Calendar. Many users of The Events Calendar and associated plugins, are already using block editor functionality and many more are just starting out. Now is the time to decide if Block Editor is right for your site and your Events Calendar usage.

But after "switching back" by installing a plugin—like Disable Gutenberg (https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-gutenberg/) or Classic Editor (https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)—you are seeing some weirdness. Maybe it's unexpected things in the editor or maybe it's blocks still showing up on the page or post after they've been removed. How can you fix that?

 You should. It is always best for you, the site owner, to have access to your account here on theeventscalendar.com. That’s how you access downloads, license keys, subscription details, billing information, and support.
 We recommend purchasing a subscription under your own name and giving your developer the license key for the site. ...</div>
